## Project Title
Sentiment Analytics and Visualization of News Datasets(INF4000)

## Project Description
This study explored the sentiment and category distribution of articles over time in the news using R, because we want to understand how news content affects public sentiment and the focus of social attention. A stacked line chart was used to show distribution of article categories by time. Stacked bar chart was used to express emotional distribution by category. Number of news articles by hierarchical classification was showed using tree map. And Scatter chart was used to show changes in the number of news sources published over time.
